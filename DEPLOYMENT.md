# Deployment Instructions

## Upload to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Choose a repository name (e.g., `crud-products-dashboard`)
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

2. **Connect your local repository to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crud-products-dashboard.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify the upload**
   - Check that all files are uploaded correctly
   - Ensure the repository is public
   - Verify that README.md is displayed properly

## Project Structure on GitHub

The repository should contain:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `SETUP.md` - Setup instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This file
- `package.json` - Root project configuration
- `backend/` - Laravel application
- `frontend/` - Vue.js application
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Important Notes

- The `.env` files are not included in the repository (for security)
- Users need to create their own `.env` files following the setup instructions
- The project uses MySQL database - users need to configure their own database
- All dependencies are defined in `composer.json` and `package.json` files

## Testing the Deployment

After uploading to GitHub, test the setup:

1. Clone the repository to a new location
2. Follow the setup instructions in `SETUP.md`
3. Verify that both backend and frontend work correctly
4. Test all CRUD operations
5. Verify authentication works

## Repository URL

Once uploaded, share the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crud-products-dashboard
```
